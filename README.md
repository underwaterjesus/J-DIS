Julia Digital Image Steganography is a julia application that uses Least Significant Bit Steganography to hide files in digital images.<br><br>
The purpose of this project is to become more familiar with the julia programming language in a fun and interesting way, as my final year project in university will be primarily written in julia. Because this is just a fun project to further other goals long term support is unlikely, but hopefully others find it intersesting and useful too.<br><br>
## Goals
By the end of this project I hope that the application will be able to hide multiple file types - ideally .txt, .pdf, .zip, and any of the main digital image extensions - in each of the major digital image types - .png, .jpg, .gif, .bmp and .tiff.<br><br>
In the course of making this application, I might discover that some of the goals are not achievable in th julia language or are above my current ability.<br><br>
## Milestones
- Hide .txt files in .png files (05/09/2020)
